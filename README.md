                                                                  React calculator project 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
React application that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations. The project is designed to be a simple introduction to React and its components.
The project is made up of two main components: the Calculator component and the Button component. The Calculator component is responsible for displaying the calculator interface and handling user input. The Button component is responsible for rendering the calculator buttons and handling button clicks.
The Calculator component uses the useState hook to track the state of the calculator. The state includes the current value of the display, the current operation, and the previous number. The Button component uses the onClick event to handle button clicks. When a button is clicked, the Button component calls a function in the Calculator component to update the state of the calculator.
The Calculator component also uses the useEffect hook to update the display when the state of the calculator changes. When the state of the calculator changes, the useEffect hook calls a function to render the updated display.
